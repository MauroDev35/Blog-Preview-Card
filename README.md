## My process
In order to make this challenge I first added some semantic tags in the HTML code such as main and added some div tags to get everything more organized and bundle the different information. After this I made the CSS code in order to get everything in the right place with the right design according to the instructions, finally added some animations when hovering the images and yellow button.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have practiced a lot about animations such as the transition property as well as I learned the translate property with the scale and how to use it which I find very useful.

### Continued development

I'd like to keep focusing on learning animations while practicing my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills

### Useful resources

- [CSS tool](https://10015.io/tools/css-box-shadow-generator#google_vignette) - This helped me creating the shadow for the blog card.
- [Animista](https://animista.net/) - This is an amazing tool that helped to have some inspiration in the animations I wanted to use.
